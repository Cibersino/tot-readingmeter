# App-level Manual Test Suite (Release Smoke + Regression)

**Purpose:** Provide a single, stable, app-level manual test suite to run:
- **Before every release** (fast “Release smoke” subset).
- **After high-risk refactors** (full regression).

**Scope coverage (app-level):**
- Startup + first-run language selection
- Clipboard overwrite/append, empty text, automatic count/time calculation
- Counting mode (simple/precise) + consistency
- Presets CRUD + defaults restore + persistence
- Manual editor window (open/edit/apply semantics)
- Text snapshot feature (save, load, persistence)
- Task editor window (task lists, library, links, column widths, window position).
- Stopwatch (velocity) + floating window behavior (unfocused app)
- Menu actions: Guide/Instructions/FAQ/About (+ link routing)
- Persistence sanity (settings/current_text/editor_state)
- i18n: language switching + number formatting consistency
- Updater check (manual)

---

## 0) Definitions

- **Release smoke:** 5–15 minutes, minimum confidence gate for publishing.
- **Full regression:** 30–60 minutes, end-to-end validation across all primary windows/flows.

---

## 1) Preconditions / Test Environments

### 1.1 Supported environments (minimum)

- OS: Windows 10/11.
- Build: Prefer **packaged ZIP build** for “Release smoke”.
  - Dev mode is acceptable for most UI flows, but **some doc-opening behaviors differ** (see 1.3).

### 1.2 Required conditions

- Clipboard access available (to test overwrite/append).
- Network access available for updater check (GitHub API).

### 1.3 Dev vs packaged caveats (important)

- `open-app-doc` behavior differs in dev for some documents:
  - Electron/Chromium license docs are explicitly “not available in dev” per policy; validate those in packaged build.
- Updater check depends on `app.getVersion()` and GitHub latest release tag; packaged build gives the most realistic signal.

---

## 2) Test State Variants (must support both)

You must run tests under both:
1) **Clean first-run** (no config present)
2) **Existing user state** (config present)

### 2.1 Where user state lives

Config is stored under Electron `app.getPath('userData')/config` and includes:
- `user_settings.json`
- `current_text.json`
- `editor_state.json`
- `presets_defaults/*.json` (runtime defaults copies)
- `saved_current_texts/*.json` (saved text snapshots)
- `tasks/` (created on first use of the task editor)
  - `tasks/lists/*.json` (saved task lists)
  - `tasks/library.json` (task row library)
  - `tasks/allowed_hosts.json` (allowlist for https link opening)
  - `tasks/column_widths.json` (task editor column widths)
  - `tasks/task_editor_position.json` (task editor last position; x/y only)

**Windows example (typical):**
`%APPDATA%\@cibersino\tot\config\...`

### 2.2 How to force Clean first-run

1. Fully close the app.
2. Rename or delete the `config/` directory described above.
3. Launch the app.

Expected: language selection path should be reachable on first run (see FR-01).

---

## 3) Test Data (use consistent inputs)

Use the following test text(s) for repeatability.

### 3.1 Small text (multiline + punctuation)

```
¡!
Buen día niñ@s.
Esto es una prueba: 1,234.56 — ¿funciona?
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 👨‍👩‍👧 👨‍👩 👨 . . . . . . . ... ///   
```

### 3.2 Large text (edge-case only)

Any text large enough to stress editor limits and truncation messaging (see Edge cases).

---

## 4) Release Smoke (5–15 minutes)

Record each test as Pass/Fail. If Fail, file an issue and reference it in the run log.

### SM-01 Startup + main window ready
**Goal:** app opens and main UI is usable.
1. Launch the app.
2. Confirm main window shows text preview + results section + stopwatch section.

**Expected:**
- No blocking modal/errors.
- Main controls exist (Overwrite/Append, Editor, Trash, Load/Save snapshots, Precise toggle, Presets controls, Stopwatch controls).

### SM-02 First-run language selection reachable (clean run only)
**Goal:** first-run language path is reachable and applies.
1. (Clean run) Launch app after removing config.
2. If language window appears, search/filter list and select **Español achilenao (`es-cl`)** (or any other language available).
3. Confirm window closes and app continues.

**Expected:**
- Language is applied without crash.
- If language picker does not appear automatically, it must be reachable via menu “Preferences → Language” (see REG-I18N-01).

### SM-03 Clipboard overwrite + automatic results
**Goal:** overwrite-from-clipboard updates preview + counts + time.
1. Copy text to clipboard.
2. Click **📋↺**.
3. Observe preview and results.

**Expected:**
- Preview shows start/end of the text (or full if short).
- Words/chars/time update immediately.

### SM-04 Append clipboard (+ newline semantics)
**Goal:** append-from-clipboard adds new content and updates counts.
1. Copy text to clipboard.
2. Click **📋+**.
3. Observe preview and results.

**Expected:**
- Text length increases; preview changes accordingly.
- Counts/time increase.

### SM-05 Empty current text
**Goal:** clearing text resets results.
1. Click Trash (🗑) on main window.
2. Observe preview and results.

**Expected:**
- Preview shows empty-state label.
- Words/chars/time go to zero.
- Stopwatch is reset because current text becomes empty.

### SM-06 Counting mode toggle (precise/simple)
**Goal:** toggle works and results remain coherent.
1. Set non-empty text (SM-03).
2. Toggle “Modo preciso” on/off.
3. Observe that results change only in ways consistent with mode differences.

**Expected:**
- Toggle state changes and is preserved during session.
- No NaN/blank results.

### SM-07 Presets: select an existing preset updates time
**Goal:** selecting a preset changes WPM and time estimate.
1. In the preset selector, choose a preset (e.g., “default” or any available).
2. Observe WPM input/slider and time estimate.

**Expected:**
- WPM input/slider reflect preset WPM.
- Time estimate recalculates (same words, different time).

### SM-08 Editor window open + edit sync
**Goal:** editor opens and changes propagate to main.
1. Click manual editor (⌨).
2. Modify text.
3. Observe main window preview/results.
4. Close editor.

**Expected:**
- Main window reflects editor changes.
- No crash; no stuck “editor loader”.

### SM-09 Stopwatch + floating window quick check
**Goal:** stopwatch runs and floating window reflects state.
1. With non-empty text, press ▶ to start stopwatch.
2. Wait ~2–3 seconds; press pause.
3. Toggle floating window (label may appear as **VF**/**FW** depending language).
4. Confirm floating window shows same time/state; try start/pause from floating window.

**Expected:**
- Stopwatch display increments while running.
- Main and floating window remain synchronized after pause/resume actions from either window.

### SM-10 Menu: About + Updater
**Goal:** About modal loads and updater check is reachable.
1. Menu → open **About**.
2. Confirm modal opens and contains content.
3. Menu → run **Actualizar versión**.

**Expected:**
- About modal opens and content is readable; version/environment fields hydrate when available.
- Updater shows a dialog (up-to-date / update available / failure).

### SM-11 Current text snapshots (Save/Load)
**Goal:** save and load a snapshot via native dialogs.
1. Set non-empty text (SM-03).
2. Click **💾** and save as `smoke_snapshot.json` under `config/saved_current_texts/`.
3. Change current text (SM-04 or edit in editor).
4. Click **📂**, select `smoke_snapshot.json`, and confirm overwrite.

**Expected:**
- Snapshot file is created.
- Current text is overwritten; preview/results update.
- Stopwatch behavior follows REG-CRONO-02 semantics (non-empty restore: no reset; empty restore: reset).

### SM-12 Task editor: open + basic save
**Goal:** save and load tasks.
1. From the main window, click **📝** (new task) to open the task editor.
2. Add one row with required text (and any numeric fields as desired).
3. Save the task list (accept the save dialog; choose a name).
4. Close the task editor, click **🗃️** (load task), and verify the saved data is present.

**Expected:** 
- task editor opens
- save/load round-trip works

---

## 5) Full Regression Suite (30–60 minutes)

### REG-FR — First-run & language selection

#### REG-FR-01 Clean run: language picker behavior
**Goal:** first-run supports language selection.
1. Remove config (2.2).
2. Launch app.
3. Use search box to filter language list; select language.

**Expected:**
- Filtering works; selection applies; window closes.

#### REG-FR-02 Existing state: no first-run surprises
**Goal:** existing config loads without resets.
1. Launch app normally with existing config.
2. Confirm last-used language/text/presets/mode are consistent with prior run.

**Expected:**
- No unexpected resets of presets/text unless intentionally cleared.

#### REG-FR-03 First-run fallback when closing language window
**Goal:** startup remains unblocked if language window closes without explicit selection.
1. Remove config (2.2).
2. Launch app to show the language window.
3. Close the language window using the window close button (without selecting language).

**Expected:**
- App continues startup and main window opens.
- A safe fallback language is applied/persisted.
- No startup deadlock or blank state.

---

### REG-MAIN — Main window counting, preview, and consistency

#### REG-MAIN-01 Preview behavior (short vs long)
**Goal:** preview reflects correct short/long logic.
1. Set small text → confirm preview shows full (if within inline threshold).
2. Append small text repeatedly until preview truncates.
3. Observe preview shows “start… | …end” style.

**Expected:**
- Short text shows fully; long text shows start/end preview.

#### REG-MAIN-02 Overwrite vs append semantics
**Goal:** overwrite replaces, append adds with newline intent.
1. Overwrite with small text; capture counts.
2. Append small text; counts increase.
3. Overwrite again with small text; counts return near original.

**Expected:**
- Overwrite does not keep previous text; append does.

#### REG-MAIN-03 Empty text + stopwatch reset coupling
**Goal:** clearing text resets stopwatch reliably.
1. Click trash in Text Selector.

**Expected:**
- Text clears.
- Stopwatch resets to `00:00:00`.

#### REG-MAIN-04 Snapshots: overwrite + cancel semantics
**Goal:** load behaves like an overwrite flow; cancels are no-ops.
1. Set a known text `T1` (SM-03).
2. Click **💾** → `reg_T1.json` under `config/saved_current_texts/`.
3. Change current text to `T2`.
4. Click **📂** → select `reg_T1.json` → **cancel** overwrite confirmation.
5. Click **📂** again → select `reg_T1.json` → **confirm** overwrite.

**Expected:**
- After cancel: current text remains `T2`.
- After confirm: current text becomes `T1` and UI updates.

---

### REG-MODE — Counting mode (simple/precise)

#### REG-MODE-01 Toggle persistence in-session
**Goal:** toggle affects counting without breaking formatting.
1. With non-empty text, toggle precise mode on/off multiple times.
2. Observe counts update each time and remain formatted.

**Expected:**
- No blank results; mode toggles reliably.

#### REG-MODE-02 Mode persisted across restart (existing-config)
**Goal:** mode stored in settings persists.
1. Set mode to “simple”.
2. Close app, relaunch.
3. Confirm mode toggle state matches prior selection.

**Expected:**
- Mode is restored from settings and reflected in UI toggle.

---

### REG-PRESETS — Presets CRUD, defaults, and persistence

#### REG-PRESETS-01 Create preset
**Goal:** create a new preset and verify selection.
1. Click **Nuevo**.
2. Enter name (e.g., `test`), WPM 300, with a description (optional).
3. Save.

**Expected:**
- Preset appears in select list and becomes selectable.
- Selecting it updates WPM + time estimate.

#### REG-PRESETS-02 Edit preset
**Goal:** edit an existing preset and verify it updates.
1. Select `test`.
2. Click **Editar**.
3. Change WPM to 275 and save.
4. Save and confirm dialog.

**Expected:**
- Preset now shows updated WPM and affects time estimate.

#### REG-PRESETS-03 Change language
1. Change app language to another base language and open the preset dropdown list. 

**Expected:**
- New and edited preset is not showing.

#### REG-PRESETS-04 Delete preset
**Goal:** delete a user preset and verify it disappears.
1. Go back to the previous language.
2. Select `test`.
3. Click delete (🗑).
4. Save and confirm dialog.

**Expected:**
- Preset no longer appears.
- App selects a safe fallback preset (e.g., “default” or first available).

#### REG-PRESETS-05 Repeat REG-01 to REG-04 with default presets
1. Repeat edit/delete flows with a **general default** preset (e.g., `default`).
2. Repeat edit/delete flows with a **language default** preset (if present in current language).
3. After deleting a default preset in current language, switch to another language and verify it is not globally removed.
4. Run **Restore defaults (R)** and verify removed defaults reappear for current language.

**Expected:**
- Default preset edit/delete flows complete without corruption/crash.
- Deletion of defaults respects language scoping (no unintended cross-language removal).
- Restore defaults recovers removed defaults for the active language.

#### REG-PRESETS-06 Restore defaults
**Goal:** restoring defaults yields a sane list and selection.
1. Click **R** (reset defaults).
2. Verify preset list repopulates.

**Expected:**
- Defaults restored; selection remains valid or falls back safely.

#### REG-PRESETS-07 Persistence across sessions
**Goal:** selected preset persists for language base.
1. Create or edit a preset.
2. Select it.
3. Close app; relaunch.
4. Verify the same preset is selected and applied.

**Expected:**
- Selected preset persisted and reapplied.

---

### REG-EDITOR — Manual editor flows and semantics

#### REG-EDITOR-01 Open editor and initial content
**Goal:** editor opens with current text.
1. Set a known text in main.
2. Open editor.
3. Verify editor area contains the same text.

**Expected:**
- Editor initializes from current text.

#### REG-EDITOR-02 Edit and propagate
**Goal:** editor edits update main view.
1. Modify text in manual editor (add/remove a line).
2. Paste/drop any text directly.
3. Overwrite/append with main window buttons.
4. Observe main window updates (wait 1 second or after apply/close).

**Expected:**
- Main reflects updated text and recounts results.

#### REG-EDITOR-03 CALCULAR
1. Uncheck automatic calculation in manual editor.
2. Modify text and wait.
3. Press CALCULAR.

**Expected:**
- Main reflects updated text only after you press the button.

#### REG-EDITOR-04 Editor clear
**Goal:** clearing inside editor clears main consistently.
1. Use editor clear control (trash/clear).
2. Confirm main shows empty state.

**Expected:**
- Editor clear sends state update to main; both stay consistent.

#### REG-EDITOR-05 Find (Ctrl+F) — modal mode + navigation + highlight
**Goal:** Find works on textarea content, does not edit text, scrolls to matches, and shows highlight while focus stays in find input.
1. Ensure editor has a text with repeated terms across multiple lines (use Small text, then add a repeated word like `prueba` in several lines).
2. Press **Ctrl+F** (or Cmd+F on macOS).
3. Type a query that has multiple matches.
4. Navigate:
   - **Enter** = next
   - **Shift+Enter** = previous
   - **F3** / **Shift+F3** = next/previous
5. While Find is open:
   - Try typing in the textarea, pressing Enter/Backspace, pasting (Ctrl+V), and dropping text.
6. Confirm visibility:
   - Match highlight must be visible even when focus is in the find input.
   - Use Next/Prev to jump to matches that are off-screen; verify internal textarea scroll moves to the match.
7. Scroll the textarea manually (mouse wheel / scrollbar) while Find remains open.

**Expected:**
- Find opens and focuses the find input.
- Navigation selects the match and scrolls the textarea so the match is in view.
- Text is not modifiable while Find is open (readOnly/modal behavior + blocked paste/drop/input).
- Highlight remains visible while focus stays in the find input (overlay-based highlight).
- Highlight stays aligned while scrolling the textarea.
- **Esc** closes Find and restores normal editing.

#### REG-EDITOR-06 Undo/Redo semantics (including Find not polluting edits)
**Goal:** Undo/Redo behaves predictably for edits and is not affected by Find navigation.
1. In editor, type a short string (e.g., `AAA`) in the middle of the text.
2. Press **Ctrl+Z** (undo) → verify the insertion is reverted.
3. Press **Ctrl+Y** (redo) (or Ctrl+Shift+Z depending on OS/browser behavior) → verify the insertion returns.
4. Paste a short string (Ctrl+V) in the middle; undo/redo it.
5. Open Find (**Ctrl+F**), search and navigate multiple times (Enter/F3), then close Find (Esc).
6. Press **Ctrl+Z** once.

**Expected:**
- Undo/Redo works for typing edits and paste edits in the textarea.
- Find open/navigate/close does not modify the document.
- After using Find, **Ctrl+Z** undoes the last real edit (not “selection movement” from Find), and the text remains intact.

---

### REG-TASKS — Task editor (lists, library, links)

#### REG-TASKS-01 Open new task editor + close guard
**Goal:** Task editor window open/close correctly.
1. From the main window, click new task (**📝**).
2. Verify the task editor window opens and is interactive (you can add/edit rows).
3. Attempt to close with unsaved changes:
   - Cancel keeps the window open.
   - Confirm closes the window.

**Expected:**
- Window opens.
- Close confirmation behaves correctly.

#### REG-TASKS-02 Save + load task list
**Goal:** saved list can be reopened.
1. Open Tasks editor (📝).
2. Add 2 rows with distinct values.
3. Save as a new list (name: e.g., "demo").
4. Close editor.
5. Click **🗃️** to load a Task in the saved folder.
6. Click Save again and choose the same filename (overwrite).

**Expected:**
- Loaded list shows the same rows + meta name.
- Overwrite confirmation: at most one confirmation (OS dialog); no additional in-app overwrite prompt.

#### REG-TASKS-03 Delete task list
**Goal:** Delete a task is working.
1. Load a previously saved list so a source path is present.
2. Trigger delete; accept the confirmation.
3. Try loading the same list again.

**Expected:**
- Delete removes the file.
- Deleted list is no longer available in the open dialog (or, if force-selected by path, load fails safely with user-facing notice).

#### REG-TASKS-04 Library save/load/delete
**Goal:** Save and load a text row to general library.
1. Save a row to the library (once without comment, once with comment if supported).
2. Open the library modal and verify the saved entry appears.
3. Insert/apply the library entry into the current task list.
4. Delete the library entry and verify it disappears.

**Expected:**
- Library list/save/delete works.
- Confirmation deny is a no-op.

#### REG-TASKS-05 Column widths persistence
**Goal:** Resize columns widths.
1. Resize at least two task editor columns.
2. Close and reopen the task editor.
3. Verify the widths persisted.

**Expected:**
- Column widths restore on open.

#### REG-TASKS-06 Link opening
**Goal:** link opening respects https + allowlist rules.
1. Open Tasks editor and add a row with Link populated.
2. Test cases:
   a) https://example.com (first time): confirm dialog; can "trust host"; opens.
   b) https://example.com (after trusting): opens without confirm.
   c) http://example.com: blocked; show "Link blocked."
   d) Local absolute path (e.g., C:\Users\...\file.pdf):
      - With an existing file: confirm dialog; opens if accepted.
      - With a missing file: show "File not found."

**Expected:**
- Confirm prompt appears for (a) and (d) and not for (b).
- (c) is blocked with user-visible notice.
- Local path opens only if the file exists and the user confirms.

#### REG-TASKS-07 Task editor window position persistence
**Goal:** Task editor position keep the same position after close.
1. Open the task editor and move it to a noticeable position.
2. Close and reopen the task editor.
3. Verify the position is restored (size may remain fixed).

**Expected:**
- Position (x/y) is restored.

---

### REG-CRONO — Stopwatch + floating window

#### REG-CRONO-01 Start/pause/reset in main
**Goal:** stopwatch controls behave correctly.
1. Start (▶), wait, pause, reset (⏹).
2. Confirm display changes as expected.

**Expected:**
- Time increments while running; reset returns to 00:00:00.

#### REG-CRONO-02 Text change semantics (non-empty vs empty)
**Goal:** non-empty text changes do not reset, but empty text does reset.
1. Start stopwatch.
2. While running, overwrite/append with a **non-empty** text (clipboard or editor).
3. Confirm stopwatch does **not** reset.
4. Clear current text (trash in main window).
5. Confirm stopwatch resets.

**Expected:**
- Non-empty text changes keep elapsed state.
- Clearing text resets to `00:00:00`.

#### REG-CRONO-03 Floating window state sync + unfocused behavior
**Goal:** floating window remains usable when main is unfocused.
1. Enable floating window (label may appear as **VF**/**FW** depending language).
2. Alt-tab away (unfocus app), then interact with floating window (play/pause/stop).
3. Verify state remains consistent when returning to main.

**Expected:**
- Floating window remains usable while main is unfocused and stays synchronized with main stopwatch state.

---

### REG-MENU — Menu actions and routing (Guide/Instructions/FAQ/About)

#### REG-MENU-01 Open Guide/Instructions/FAQ
**Goal:** info modal loads content and scrolls to section.
1. Open Guide (guia_basica), then Instructions, then FAQ via menu.
2. Confirm correct section visible.

**Expected:**
- Info modal opens; content loads from `public/info/*` and scroll targeting works.

#### REG-MENU-02 About modal hydration
**Goal:** About shows version + runtime info when available.
1. Open About.
2. Confirm version and environment fields are populated (or show N/A safely).

**Expected:**
- No crash; safe fallback when APIs unavailable.

#### REG-MENU-03 Link opening restrictions
**Goal:** external links are restricted; app docs open properly (packaged preferred).
1. From About (or other UI link points), attempt to open:
   - GitHub release/docs links (allowed host)
   - DOI links from “Links de interés” (allowed host)
2. (Packaged build) open bundled docs (LICENSE, PRIVACY, etc.) if wired in UI.

**Expected:**
- Only HTTPS + allowlisted hosts are opened externally (GitHub/DOI set).
- App docs open via OS viewer; missing docs yield safe failure.

---

### REG-PERSIST — Persistence sanity

#### REG-PERSIST-01 Files created as expected (clean run)
**Goal:** app creates minimal state files.
1. Clean run launch.
2. Perform: set text, change mode, select a preset, open editor once.
3. Close app.
4. Verify config files exist (`user_settings.json`, `current_text.json`, `editor_state.json`).

**Expected:**
- Files exist; JSON is valid; no zero-byte corruption.

#### REG-PERSIST-02 Restore with existing config
**Goal:** relaunch loads last state.
1. Relaunch app.
2. Confirm:
   - last text restored
   - last language/mode restored
   - selected preset restored

**Expected:**
- State matches prior session (unless intentionally cleared).

#### REG-PERSIST-03 Snapshots folder + subfolder load (relaunch)
**Goal:** snapshots work under `config/saved_current_texts/` (including subfolders) across relaunch.
1. Set a known text `TP1`.
2. Click **💾** and save as `sub/persist_TP1.json` under `config/saved_current_texts/` (create `sub/` if needed).
3. Close app and relaunch.
4. Click **📂**, select `sub/persist_TP1.json`, confirm overwrite.

**Expected:**
- Snapshot remains on disk after relaunch.
- Loading from a descendant subfolder works and overwrites current text.

#### REG-PERSIST-04 Tasks: config/tasks persistence (lists, library, allowlist, widths, window position)
**Goal:** task feature state persists under config/tasks and reloads correctly after restart.
1. Click **📝** to open Tasks editor.
2. Resize at least two columns to non-default widths.
3. Add a row with a distinctive Text + Time and an optional Comment.
4. Save the list (name: e.g., "persist_demo").
5. Save the same row into Library (choose Include comment = Yes).
6. Open an https link to a new host and choose "Trust this host from now on".
7. Move the Tasks editor window to a distinctive position; close the editor; quit the app.
8. Inspect `config/tasks/` on disk:
   - `lists/persist_demo.json` exists
   - `library.json` exists
   - `allowed_hosts.json` exists
   - `column_widths.json` exists
   - `task_editor_position.json` exists
9. Relaunch the app.
10. Open Tasks editor and verify:
    - Window position restored (x/y) and fully visible.
    - Column widths restored.
    - Library entry still present.
    - Opening a link to the trusted host does not prompt again.

**Expected:**
- All files above exist and are valid JSON.
- Tasks state (position, column widths, library, allowed hosts) persists across restart.

---

### REG-I18N — Language switching and number formatting

#### REG-I18N-01 Switch language via Preferences menu
**Goal:** language selection window is reachable and applies.
1. Menu → Preferences → Language.
2. Select a different language.
3. Confirm UI text changes and number formatting remains consistent.

**Expected:**
- Language window works; UI strings update.
- Numbers use correct separators per language settings.

#### REG-I18N-02 Cross-window i18n consistency
**Goal:** editor/preset/flotante reflect language updates.
1. Change language.
2. Open editor, preset modal, floating window, task editor.

**Expected:**
- Each window applies translations without crash.

---

### REG-UPDATER — Manual update check

#### REG-UPDATER-01 Up-to-date path (or failure-safe)
**Goal:** updater check shows a user-visible result and never silently updates.
1. Menu → “Actualizar versión”.
2. Observe dialog result.

**Expected:**
- If up to date: dialog indicates so.
- If network unavailable / API failure: dialog indicates failure (manual path).

---

## 6) Edge Cases / Known-Risk Scenarios (run as needed)

### EDGE-01 Large paste / truncation behavior
**Goal:** app handles oversized text safely.
1. Attempt to paste/drop very large text in editor (well above paste/drop threshold).
2. Attempt to exceed max text size by typing/concatenating until near hard limit.
3. Observe notices and resulting text size.

**Expected:**
- Oversized paste/drop is rejected or limited safely (no freeze/crash).
- Hard-cap overflow paths truncate safely when applicable.
- UI remains responsive and user receives notice on limit/truncation scenarios.

### EDGE-02 Offline updater
**Goal:** updater fails gracefully without hanging.
1. Disable network.
2. Run updater check.

**Expected:**
- Safe failure dialog; no crash.

### EDGE-03 Corrupt JSON recovery
**Goal:** app recovers from invalid JSON using fallback.
1. (Advanced) Corrupt `user_settings.json` or `current_text.json` (invalid JSON).
2. Launch app.

**Expected:**
- App logs warning and uses fallback values; remains usable.

### EDGE-04 Snapshot load: invalid file + outside snapshots tree
**Goal:** invalid/outside selections do not crash and do not change current text.
1. Set a known current text `TE1`.
2. Create `config/saved_current_texts/invalid.json` with invalid JSON (e.g., `{`).
3. Click **📂** and select `invalid.json`.
4. Click **📂** again and select a JSON file outside `config/saved_current_texts/` (navigate via dialog).
5. (Advanced) Repeat step 4 via a symlink/junction escape if applicable.

**Expected:**
- Invalid snapshot shows failure notice; current text remains `TE1`.
- Outside-tree selection is rejected with “outside snapshots tree” notice; current text remains `TE1`.
- No crash/hang.

---

## 7) Result Recording

Create a short log entry for each run (store wherever the release process stores evidence).

### 7.1 Run metadata (minimum)
