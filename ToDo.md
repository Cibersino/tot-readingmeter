# ToDo / Roadmap

GitHub Project: [toT Roadmap](https://github.com/users/Cibersino/projects/2)

Rules
- Do not track status here. Status/prioritization live in the Project fields (Queue/Status/Milestone).
- Work details, specs and decisions live in GitHub Issues (linked from the Project).
- Releases are managed via Milestones (SemVer: 0.1.0, 0.1.1, 0.2.0, ...).

How to add work
- Create an Issue with appropriate labels (area:* + severity/status when applicable).
- Keep it `status:needs-triage` until it has a decision/breakdown.
- The Project auto-add workflow should pull it into “toT Roadmap”.
